"LEAP Web" is the web-based component of the LEAP Platform, providing the following services:

* User support help tickets.
* Billing

This web application is written in Ruby on Rails 3, using CouchDB as the backend data store.

Installation
---------------------------

Typically, this application is installed automatically as part of the LEAP Platform. To install it manually for testing or development, follow these instructions:

### Install system requirements

    sudo apt-get install git ruby1.8 rubygems1.8 couchdb
    sudo gem install bundler

On Debian Wheezy or later, there is a Debian package for bundler, so you can alternately run ``sudo apt-get install bundler``.

### Download source

    git clone git://leap.se/leap_web
    cd leap_web
    git submodule update --init

### Install required ruby libraries

    cd leap_web
    bundle

Typically, you run ``bundle`` as a normal user and it will ask you for a sudo password when it is time to install the required gems. If you don't have sudo, run ``bundle`` as root.

Configuration
----------------------------

The webapp can hand out certs for the EIP client. These certs are either picked from a pool in CouchDB or from a file. For now you can either run [Leap CA](http://github.com/leapcode/leap_ca) to fill the pool or you can put your certs file in config/cert.

We also ship provider information through the webapp. For now please add your eip-service.json to the public/config directory.

Copy the example configuration file and customize as appropriate:
     cp config/config.yml.example config/config.yml

Running
-----------------------------

    cd leap_web
    rails server

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
